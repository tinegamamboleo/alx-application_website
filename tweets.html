            <h1>DETAILS</h1>
            <p>
                In this article we are going to look on the basics of website development.
                they include html,css,javascript,disquis comment and behing social.
            </p> 
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
                HTML is the markup language with which all webpages are written. In this project, 
                you will write a basic website about a topic of your choice.
            </p>
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you have a fully-fledged HTML website, you may notice that even though it is already using 
                the same markup language as all webpages online, HTML doesn't offer many opportunities to make
                your website look the way you like, or even look good at all. To that end, we'll use the CSS language.
            </p> 
            <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <p>
                Your website probably looks very good now! But it also probably could use a little bit extra
                visual feedback to give the user.
            </p>
            <h3>project: a smart thumbnail</h3>
            <p>
                The point of the this part of your project is to display a large image as a smaller thumbnail,
                allowing the user to click on it to make it bigger. During this part of the project, we're going to 
                be writing code in two locations: in a .js file so that
                the webpages run it each time they load; and we'll also run code in the browser's JavaScript
                console, just to test stuff as the webpage is live in our browser. First, let's set both of those up.
